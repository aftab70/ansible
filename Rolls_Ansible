Using the ansible-galaxy command line tool that comes bundled with Ansible, you can create a role with the init command. For example, the following will create a role directory structure called test-role-1 in the current working directory:

$ ansible-galaxy init role_name here

The test-role-1 directory will contain the following:

.travis.yml
README.md
defaults/
    main.yml
files/
handlers/
    main.yml
meta/
    main.yml
tasks/
    main.yml
templates/
tests/
    inventory
    test.yml
vars/
    main.yml
